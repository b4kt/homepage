	<h2> - Using the Bypass Script - </h2>
	<h6 align="left"> This bypass goes in your bookmarks bar, you first click the button which will copy the javascript to your clipboard. Next, either create a new bookmark and paste it in the link section of the bookmark, or right click an empty part of the bookmarks bar and click paste. The way to use the bookmark is to open a website like google (has to be an actual page not just a new tab), and click the bookmark, it will open on top of the current page. </h6>	<br><br>
		<h2> - Using the Local Bypass - </h2>
	<h6 align="left"> This bypass is a local file you put in your downloads, and when used, should be invisible to any chrome spyware addons, A.k.a Go Guardian and such. Make sure you right click any spyware addons, go to the addon settings and turn <b> OFF</b> local urls, this disables them being able to see the bypass. Once loaded you just click the button and it will open a new page, you can close the first page and keep the about:blank page, then you can use the proxies as normal without censorship. </h6>
